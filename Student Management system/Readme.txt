#todo Basic Structure of our gui AND ITS FUNCTIONALITIES  will we like

first a Headline, "Welcome to Student Management System"
Then we will show some pictures and text 
then we will first have a page with 2 options user name and pass
If entered user name and pass are same then he can see his profile
on the profile first show his image and basic data
Then we will have options like See Exam marks , see results, see fees status, see documents etc

this all will be co-ordinated with the sql database where all information is being stored using multiple tables
