Here we are  enlisting the mean Squared losses of the various Regression models that we
HAve tried to implement

Logistic Regression = -21.59374
Linear Regression  = -1.3431518489511391
Ridge Regression = -1.339419483811758
Lasso Regression = -1.3418256899682635
Binary Tree Regression = -2.239583333333333
Random Forest Regression = -1.6290210416666668

Hence It is concluded that the top 3 Regressors are Linearm , Ridge and Lasso
